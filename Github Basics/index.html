                    <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of
                        snapshots (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each
                        snapshot you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of
                        a full app. During this time you can make branches to experiment and
                        come back to a previous snapshots you took or merge those experiements
                        into the your app.</p>

                    <span class="side_title">What is GitHub?</span>
                    <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
                        It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using those
                        code snapshots that you took during development.</p>

                        <p><span class="term">Git add</span> is how we stage the intergration of our current code base into our current lis of snapshots</p>

                        <p><span class="term">Git commit</span>; finally we can commit those changes we added to our last snapshot giving us a new snapshot of our code with whatever new changes were made</p>

                        <p><span class="term">Git remote add</span> is used to set up a online repository where we can place all of our currnet code. This is where the outside world can see our code base.</p>

                    <div class="explain">

                        <p><span class="term">Git push</span> is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place to store all of our repositories. Other developers might look at our existing projects to see how we approached problems, pull down our code and add new features or even update our code base with features they wanted to add</p>
